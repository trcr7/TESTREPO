When troubleshooting network connectivity or application-specific issues,
one of the first things to check should be what ports are actually in use on your system and which application is listening on a specific port.

This article explains how to use the netstat, ss and lsof commands to find out which services are listening on which ports.
The instructions are applicable for all Linux and Unix-based operating systems like macOS.

What is Listening Port
Network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and type of the communication protocol, such as TCP or UDP.

Listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a communication endpoint.

Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall.
In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.
You canâ€™t have two services listening to the same port on the same IP address.

For example,
if you are running an Apache web server that listens on ports 80 and 443 and you try to install Nginx ,
the later will fail to start because the HTTP and HTTPS ports are already in use.
Check Listening Ports with netstat
netstat is a command-line tool that can provide information about network connections.
